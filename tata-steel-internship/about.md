This is the "About" section of the project. I will explain the project in as much detail as possible. 

* Let's start with the dataset. The dataset is a flat file (a .csv file, to be precise). It is a small dataset that consists of 1338 rows and seven columns. We have six independent variables - age, sex, BMI, children, smoker, and region, and one dependent variable, charges.

* The features sex, smoker, and region are not numerical. We need to encode the features to be benificial for our analysis.

* We will **NOT** be using **One Hot Encoding** for this purpose. Rather, we will be using simple mapping for all the categorical values.
